## camel-dav

This is a fork of https://github.com/Giwi/camel-dav.
The aim of this fork is to get the component working with JBoss Fuse 6.2.1 for basic scenarios around file handling.

By the original author:

This is a Dav client based on [Sardine](https://code.google.com/p/sardine/) and largely inspired by camel-ftp.

# Still experimental, but you can be audacious and have a try :)

Let's read the guts-shaking documentation on my [Blog](http://giwi.free.fr/docs/camel-dav/)
